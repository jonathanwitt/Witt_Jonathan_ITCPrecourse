which you have lived. If you have lived in two cities or less, list two other cities that you want to visit. This section
should also contain an embedded Google Map with a marker on the city where you were born.

<!-- Add two buttons: "Previous" and "Next" below the map. Clicking the "Next" button should change the pointer to the
next city listed on your about page (i.e., a city you have lived in or want to visit). When the first of the series of
locations is selected, the "Previous" button should disappear, and when the last location is selected, the "Next" button
should disappear. Otherwise, both buttons should be visible. We encourage you to implement this using only one
iframe.
