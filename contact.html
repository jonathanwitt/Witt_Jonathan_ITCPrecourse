    <!-- add same navbar as homepage and connect them-->

    <!-- On the "Contact" page, create a contact form. The form should contain inputs for first name, last name, email,
comment. There should be an additional input type where the user can enter additional information in a non text
form. All fields except the "last name" field should be required.
-->

<!-- Add a submit button to your form. When the submit button is clicked, the browser's console should neatly display
the details entered into the form in the following format: First Name : ___, Last Name: ____, Email: ____, Comment:
____, Your Input: ____. Replace "Your Input" with a name corresponding to what you actually choose to implement.
-->

<!-- The submit button should not be functional and should look disabled as long as the required fields are not filled in
